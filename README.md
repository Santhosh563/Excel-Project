## Objective
The objective of this dashboard is to provide a comprehensive analysis of student engagement across various courses based on key performance indicators such as satisfaction rates, retention rates, attendance percentages, and gender distribution. The insights derived from this dashboard can help educators and administrators improve student experience and optimize academic strategies.

## Summary
The dashboard consists of multiple visualizations to present student engagement metrics, including:
###### Total Number of Students – 10,500 students are enrolled across different courses.
###### Average Age of Students – The average age of students is 23 years.
###### Gender Distribution – A pie chart showcases the number of male, female, and other gender categories.
###### Satisfaction Rates – A bar chart represents satisfaction scores for different courses.
###### Average Attendance – A pie chart shows the average attendance percentage for each course.
###### Retention Rates – A line graph displays retention trends for students who continued, dropped out, or are unclassified.
###### Students by Courses – A bar chart visualizes student distribution across different courses.
## Key Insights

## Conclusion
The dashboard provides a clear snapshot of student engagement, revealing key trends such as:

High student retention and satisfaction in History and Science courses.
Balanced attendance rates across different courses.
A near-equal gender distribution among students.
